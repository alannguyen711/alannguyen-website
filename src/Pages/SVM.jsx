          <div className="paragraph-content">
            Classifying cells by gene expression is important because it allows for better
            understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and pathways that govern the
            behavior of cells. The program classifies mouse brain cells by single cell RNA
            sequencing data provided by the Broad Institute, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
            Two types of classifications were used: general classification, meaning fewer classes
            of cells, and specific classification, meaning more classes of cells.

          <div className="paragraph-content">
            In previous studies classifying pancreatic and breast cancer cells, the SVM better
            classified the cells into general classes compared to the specific classes. Counter
            to what was anticipated, we noticed that the SVMâ€™s general classification
            outperformed the specific classification. This phenomenon and the lack of
            documentation on classification difficulty further motivated the questions that
            are the subject of this study: does class definition have an effect on
            classification performance, and if it does, why? If this phenomenon can be quantified
            or predicted, it can be used as a tool to help users with automatic annotation
            methods and estimate if subtypes are likely to be accurately identified or not.

            The goal of this program is to remove each of the classes in the training
            data. The most challenging part of writing this program was removing the
            columns that represented the cells in the training data, but I was able to
            accomplish this by using an intermediate array to retrieve the column labels,
            then using the DataFrame drop function. This function outputs the training
            data and labels with specific cell classes removed, which are to be used
            in
            <i> SVM_Full_Data_Function.ipynb</i>

            This program uses the csv outputs from
            <i> SVM_Full_Data_Function.ipynb </i>
            and outputs the macro and micro F1 scores for each of the specific classes. I
            used the f1_score function, imported from sklearn, but I had to take some preliminary
            steps like organizing the classes into an array and setting up a storage container for
            the values. The output of the function is two DataFrames, one storing macro F1 scores
            for each class and the other storing micro F1 scores.
